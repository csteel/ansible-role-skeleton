### The creation of this version of ansible-role-{{ role_name }}

A role skeleton generated using a customized version of the excellent
[ansible-role-skeleton](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-skeleton)
created by [Robert de Bock](https://robertdebock.nl/).

The generated skeleton was then blended with a clone this ansible role:
[github/author/ansible-role-{{ role_name }}]((https://github.com/author/ansible-role-skeleton))

This was then merged with the generated Robert de Bock style skeleton and modified
in order to support additional Linux flavours, current Ansible development and
testing methods as well as other edits and additions to enhance functionality
and clairity.
